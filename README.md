## Statistical Learning MATH 540 Final Project

### What is it about?
Simple project to compare best split metrics for the Decision Tree Classifier. Conventional gini index is compared to a more straight-forward accuracy calculation. Majority class in the leaf is taken as the prediction and compared against all the samples in this leaf. Best split is determined by the best (highest) accuracy.

## What to run?
